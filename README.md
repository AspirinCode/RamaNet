# ResottaDeNovo
Preforms De Novo Design using Machine Learning and PyRosetta to generates a novel synthesic protein structure.

## Requirements:
1. Make sure you install [PyRosetta](http://www.pyrosetta.org) as the website describes.
2. Use the following command (in GNU/Linux) to install all necessary programs and python modules for this script to run successfully:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade && sudo apt install python3-pip dssp gnuplot python-biopython python-pandas python-numpy python-matplotlib python-beautifulsoup4 python-lxml python-scipy python-tensorflow python-tqdm && sudo pip3 install keras`

## Description:
This is a script that uses Machine Learning and PyRosetta to preform *De Novo* Protein Design (from the beginning) i.e. develop and design a synthetic protein structure totally computationally. There is no input for this script, it autonomously generates a topology (random every time) then designs a sequence that fits this topology. It then submits the structure's FASTA sequence to the [Robetta](http://www.robetta.org/) server to generate and download the custom fragment files in preparation for an Abinitio fold simulation. The Abinitio script can be found [here](https://github.com/sarisabban/RosettaAbinitio). Finally it calculates the RMSD for each fragment position on the designed structure and plots an (RMSD vs Position) graph to indicate how good the Abinitio fold simulation might go (idealy you want an average RMSD < 2Ã…).

The script will generate 1 structure. It is advised to run this script in an array to generate multiple strctures and see which one has the lowest average RMSD fragments. Mind you, if you generate too many structures this might overwhelm the Robetta server by submitting and requesting too many fragment files, please be considirate and run this script once to generate 1 structure at a time only.

## How To Use:
1. You do not need to generate the Machine Learning Dataset, it is already provided, but if you want to replicate our work use the following command to generate the Machine Learning Dataset from the Protein Databank Database (computation time ~72 hours and requires ~120GB of free disk space):

`python3 Database.py`

This script will result in 1 file:

* dataPSOC.csv

Which stands for dataset of Phi pSi Omega and Constraints. The default parameters for the Database.py script is isolating proteins between 80 and 150 amino acids, and with an Rg value of less than 15. The script results in a dataset with the first column as the training example number, then the name of the PDB file, then the angles *Phi*, *Psi*, and *Omega*, then the distance between the first CA atom and subsequence CA atoms (used as *constraints*). *0.0* indicates a position with no amino acids, not all protein structures have the same length, but the entire dataset does have the same length and shape because the empty spaces are filled with zeros. If errors occure, that is fine, some protein files will cause errors (and they will be deleted/ignored), but the script should continue all the way to the end and result in a dataset file.

You can then use the following command to train the General Adverserial Neural Netowork on the dataset.

`python3 GAN.py`

But we provide a trained neural network within the DeNovo.py script, thus you can just go ahead and start your work from the next step.

2. Use the following command to preform the *De Novo* protein design:

`python3 DeNovo.py`

This script will result in 7 files:
* Topology file, which is basically just the structure of the backbone drawn using a sequence of Valine (**DeNovo.pdb**)
* Sequence designed file (**structure.pdb**)
* Abinitio input files (**structure.pdb**, **frags.200.3mers**, **frags.200.9mers**, **pre.psipred.ss2**)
* Fragment quality plot (**plot_frag.pdb**)

# This script is still under development. This statement will be removed when the script is completed and benchmarked.
# When/if this project is completed, I will make a video explaining it.
